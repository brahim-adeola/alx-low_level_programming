## 0x00-hello_world
This directory contains projects related to the basics of C programming, including compilation, assembly, and printing to the console.

## Projects
The following projects are included in this repository:

### 0-preprocessor
Write a script that runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file.
* The C file name should be saved as an external variable using `export CFILE=filename`
* * Example: `export CFILE=main.c`
*
* ### 1-compiler
* Write a script that compiles a C file but does not link.
* * The C file name should be saved as an external variable using `export CFILE=filename`
* * Example: `export CFILE=main.c`
*
* ### 2-assembler
* Write a script that generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file.
* * The C file name should be saved as an external variable using `export CFILE=filename`
* * Example: `export CFILE=main.c`
*
* ### 3-name
* Write a script that compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun.
*
* ### 4-puts
* Write a C program that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
*
* ### 5-printf
* Write a C program that prints exactly with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,, followed by a new line.
*
* ### 6-size
* Write a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on.
*
* ### 100-intel
* Write a script that generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and saves it in an output file.
* * The C file name should be saved as an external variable using `export CFILE=filename`
* * Example: `export CFILE=main.c`
*
* ### 101-quote
* Write a C program that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
*
* ## Requirements
* * All C files should end with a new line.
* * All C files should be compiled using the `-std=gnu89` flag.
* * The Betty style guide should be followed for all C code.
